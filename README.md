**Bankruptcy Prediction Model with Machine Learning**

Bankruptcy refers to a financial situation where an individual or business is unable to repay debts owed to creditors, resulting in insolvency. If you come from a commerce background and are exploring data science, this concept will likely be familiar to you.

Using **machine learning**, we can develop a model that predicts whether a company or an individual is likely to face bankruptcy in the future. In this tutorial, we’ll build such a model using **Python**.

### Building a Bankruptcy Prediction Model in Python

The dataset used for this project comes from **Kaggle**, originally provided by the **Taiwan Economic Journal**. Let’s begin by importing the dataset along with the necessary Python libraries to start building our bankruptcy prediction model.
